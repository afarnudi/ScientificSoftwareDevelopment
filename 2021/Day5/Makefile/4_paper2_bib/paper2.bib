@article{Peterson1985,
	abstract = { Abstract This paper considers the hydrodynamics of low Reynolds number shape fluctuations of incompressible fluid cells with incompressible membrane boundaries. It is assumed that the membrane can be characterized by a shear modulus μ, a bending modulus kc , an intrinsic mean curvature Co , and a surface viscosity ηM. The problem is formulated for the general case, and is solved analytically in the spherical limit. The observable hydrodynamics is found to depend sensitively on membrane parameters, and in particular a marked difference between solid and fluid behaviour is apparent. },

	abstract = {The fluctuations of two-dimensional extended objects (membranes) is a rich and exciting field with many solid results and a wide range of open issues. We review the distinct universality classes of membranes, determined by the local order, and the associated phase diagrams. After a discussion of several physical examples of membranes we turn to the physics of crystalline (or polymerized) membranes in which the individual monomers are rigidly bound. We discuss the phase diagram with particular attention to the dependence on the degree of self-avoidance and anisotropy. In each case we review and discuss analytic, numerical and experimental predictions of critical exponents and other key observables. Particular emphasis is given to the results obtained from the renormalization group ε-expansion. The resulting renormalization group flows and fixed points are illustrated graphically. The full technical details necessary to perform actual calculations are presented in the Appendices. We then turn to a discussion of the role of topological defects whose liberation leads to the hexatic and fluid universality classes. We finish with conclusions and a discussion of promising open directions for the future.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries about the molecular organization and physical properties of the mammalian erythrocyte membrane and its associated structural proteins can now be used to explain, and may eventually be used to predict, the shape of the erythrocyte. Such explanations are possible because the relatively few structural proteins of the erythrocyte are regularly distributed over the entire cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane and because the well-understood topological associations of these proteins seem to be stable in comparison with the time required for the cell to change shape. These simplifications make the erythrocyte the first nonmuscle cell for which it will be possible to extend our knowledge of molecular interactions to the next hierarchical level of organization that deals with shape and shape transformations.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular membranes display rich statistical mechanical behavior. They are classified as liquid in the absence of shear elasticity in the plane of the membrane and tethered (solid) when the neighboring molecules or subunits are connected and the membranes exhibit solid-like elastic behavior in the plane of the membrane. The spectrin skeleton of red blood cells was studied as a model tethered membrane. The static structure factor of the skeletons, measured by small-angle x-ray and light scattering, was fitted with a structure factor predicted with a model calculation. The model describes tethered membrane sheets with free edges in a flat phase, which is a locally rough but globally flat membrane configuration. The fit was good for large scattering vectors. The membrane roughness exponent, zeta, defined through h alpha L zeta, where h is the average amplitude of out-of-plane fluctuations and L is the linear membrane dimension, was determined to be 0.65 +/- 0.10. Computer simulations of model red blood cell skeletons also showed this flat phase. The value for the roughness exponent, which was determined from the scaling properties of membranes of different sizes, was consistent with that from the experiments.},

Each junction contains a regular 37-nm rod, probably an actin oligomer of approximately 13 monomers. Densities appear at variable places in the meshwork but distinct globules occur with great frequency 78 nm from the spectrin tetramer's junctional insertion end, very close to the known binding site for ankyrin. Most frequently, five or six spectrin tetramers insert into each junction, producing a meshwork that displays remarkably regular long range order.},

@article{Seifert1995,
	abstract = {Vesicles are closed surfaces of bilayer membranes. Their mean shapes and fluctuations are governed by the competition of curvature energy and geometrical constraints on the enclosed volume and total surface area. A scheme to calculate these fluctuations to lowest order in the ratio of temperature to bending rigidity is developed. It is shown that for fluctuations that break a symmetry of the mean shape the area constraint indeed acts like a tension whose value is given by the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce the area constraint in the first place. As a consequence, these fluctuations are also insensitive to the specific variants of the curvature model. For fluctuations that preserve the symmetry of the mean shape the role of the area constraint is more subtle. The low temperature expansion breaks down in the spherical limit where with the excess area another small parameter enters. By incorporating the area constraint in this limit exactly, the validity of the conventional approach using an effective tension for fluctuations of quasi-spherical vesicles can be assessed.},

	abstract = {Thermal fluctuations strongly modify the large length-scale elastic behavior of cross-linked membranes, giving rise to scale-dependent elastic moduli. Whereas thermal effects in flat membranes are well understood, many natural and artificial microstructures are modeled as thin elastic shells. Shells are distinguished from flat membranes by their nonzero curvature, which provides a size-dependent coupling between the in-plane stretching modes and the out-of-plane undulations. In addition, a shell can support a pressure difference between its interior and its exterior. Little is known about the effect of thermal fluctuations on the elastic properties of shells. Here, we study the statistical mechanics of shape fluctuations in a pressurized spherical shell, using perturbation theory and Monte Carlo computer simulations, explicitly including the effects of curvature and an inward pressure. We predict novel properties of fluctuating thin shells under point indentations and pressure-induced deformations. The contribution due to thermal fluctuations increases with increasing ratio of shell radius to thickness and dominates the response when the product of this ratio and the thermal energy becomes large compared with the bending rigidity of the shell. Thermal effects are enhanced when a large uniform inward pressure acts on the shell and diverge as this pressure approaches the classical buckling transition of the shell. Our results are relevant for the elasticity and osmotic collapse of microcapsules.},

	abstract = {Erythrocytes (red blood cells) play an essential role in the respiratory functions of vertebrates, carrying oxygen from lungs to tissues and CO(2) from tissues to lungs. They are mechanically very soft, enabling circulation through small capillaries. The small thermally induced displacements of the membrane provide an important tool in the investigation of the mechanics of the cell membrane. However, despite numerous studies, uncertainties in the interpretation of the data, and in the values derived for the main parameters of cell mechanics, have rendered past conclusions from the fluctuation approach somewhat controversial. Here we revisit the experimental method and theoretical analysis of fluctuations, to adapt them to the case of cell contour fluctuations, which are readily observable experimentally. This enables direct measurements of membrane tension, of bending modulus, and of the viscosity of the cell cytoplasm. Of the various factors that influence the mechanical properties of the cell, we focus here on: 1), the level of oxygenation, as monitored by Raman spectrometry; 2), cell shape; and 3), the concentration of hemoglobin. The results show that, contrary to previous reports, there is no significant difference in cell tension and bending modulus between oxygenated and deoxygenated states, in line with the softness requirement for optimal circulatory flow in both states. On the other hand, tension and bending moduli of discocyte- and spherocyte-shaped cells differ markedly, in both the oxygenated and deoxygenated states. The tension in spherocytes is much higher, consistent with recent theoretical models that describe the transitions between red blood cell shapes as a function of membrane tension. Cell cytoplasmic viscosity is strongly influenced by the hydration state. The implications of these results to circulatory flow dynamics in physiological and pathological conditions are discussed.},

The method is based on the quantitative analysis of a series of microscopic images captured during thermal membrane fluctuations. Thus, measured bending rigidity coefficient depends on the image quality as well as the selection of computational tools for image processing and mathematical model used. In this work scanning and spinning disc confocal microscopies were used to visualize fluctuating membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles. The bending rigidity coefficient was calculated for different acquisition modes, using different fluorescent probes and different image processing methods. It was shown that both imaging approaches gave similar bending coefficient values regardless of acquisition time. Using the developed methodology the effect of fluorescent probe type and aqueous phase composition on the value of the membrane bending rigidity coefficient was measured. Specifically it was found that the bending rigidity coefficient of DOPC bilayer in water is smaller than that determined for POPC membrane. It has been found that the POPC and DOPC bending rigidities coefficient in sucrose solution was lower than that in water. Fluorescence imaging makes possible the quantitative analysis of membrane mechanical properties of inhomogeneous membrane.},

	abstract = {The fluctuation spectrum of giant unilamellar vesicles is measured using a high-resolution contour detection technique. An analysis at higher q vectors than previously achievable is now possible due to technical improvements of the experimental setup and of the detection algorithm. The global fluctuation spectrum is directly fitted to deduce the membrane tension and the bending modulus of lipid membranes. Moreover, we show that the planar analysis of fluctuations is valid for spherical objects, even at low wave vectors. Corrections due to the integration time of the video camera and to the section of a 3D object by the observation plane are introduced. A precise calculation of the error bars has been done in order to provide reliable error estimate. Eventually, using this technique, we have measured bending moduli for EPC, SOPC and SOPC: CHOL membranes confirming previously published values. An interesting application of this technique can be the measurement of the fluctuation spectra for non-equilibrium membranes, such as "active membranes".},

@article{bivas1997,
	abstract = {Giant liposomes obtained by electroformation and observed by phase-contrast video microscopy show spontaneous deformations originating from Brownian motion that are characterized, in the case of quasispherical vesicles, by two parameters only, the membrane tension sigma and the bending elasticity k(c). For liposomes containing dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or a 10 mol% cholesterol/DMPC mixture, the mechanical property of the membrane, k(c), is shown to be temperature dependent on approaching the main (thermotropic) phase transition temperature T(m). In the case of DMPC/cholesterol bilayers, we also obtained evidence for a relation between the bending elasticity and the corresponding temperature/cholesterol molecular ratio phase diagram. Comparison of DMPC/cholesterol with DMPC/cholesterol sulfate bilayers at 30 degrees C containing 30% sterol ratio shows that k(c) is independent of the surface charge density of the bilayer. Finally, bending elasticities of red blood cell (RBC) total lipid extracts lead to a very low k(c) at 37 degrees C if we refer to DMPC/cholesterol bilayers. At 25 degrees C, the very low bending elasticity of a cholesterol-free RBC lipid extract seems to be related to a phase coexistence, as it can be observed by solid-state (31)P-NMR. At the same temperature, the cholesterol-containing RBC lipid extract membrane shows an increase in the bending constant comparable to the one observed for a high cholesterol ratio in DMPC membranes.},
